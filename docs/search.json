Well, can answer “much abundant average . bacterium site site B compared . notherbacterium?” ’s cool, people don’t . notherbacterium care . Great news – can answer “much abundant average . bacterium site site B compared average difference taxa?” , instead choosing reference taxon, can just compare average. don’t assume average change zero, course! ’re just looking ’s different. Think way: list fold-changes 20, 1.2, 1.1, 1.1, 1, 0.9 0.1, ’re probably interested 20x 0.1x fold-changers. 1.1 isn’t fold change, compared 20, ’s probably much. point, people often like, “Sounds good, just compositional transformation t-test?” . , don’t. Instead, set optimisation problem guarantees good estimate (centered) fold-changes. , can’t given general one-line closed form expression . , can sleep soundly knowing estimate - guaranteed get right get samples (experimental design implication: prioritize samples deeper sequencing) - converges distribution something nice = can give p-values probably came - doesn’t require “deal” zeroes - doesn’t require choose amongst data transformations (CLR, ALR, TSS…) - doesn’t require choose reference group - doesn’t assume data Poisson, Negative Binomial, Super Fancy Arbitrary Hierarchical Model etc-ed distributed - estimates something real (actual fold-changes abundance) clear assumptions (taxa may overdetected; consistently ) ’s --fun fact, way – “intuitive” methods log-transforms pseudocount-modified data guaranteed converge wrong answer (“inconsistency”). may wrong practice, ’ll still wrong. Maybe ’s ’s blog post another day. Part reason can side-step “zeroes logs” optimisation problem models log(mean counts), mean(log counts). compositional zealots love remind , latter isn’t defined ever zeroes. , … mean talk average collection numbers non-zero probability infinite value? doesn’t mean anything, opinion, one reason way. Instead, long positive probability species detected environment, log(mean counts) well-defined. Oh yeah, optimisation problem doesn’t care counts (integers) coverages (non-negative numbers). ’s us. , give radEmu metagenomic data! Nom nom. main ideas! rest just details, really. don’t simply t-test give p-values turns p-values small. don’t even fancy “robust” t-test, ’re still small. want best, perfect p-values possible (love details), p-values come robust score tests, performed beautifully practice. Great work, co-author David! [world Amy knows insert memes. meme Christopher Nolan’s first batman movie. Christian Bale: “supposed understand ?” Morgan Freeman: “, want know hard .”] fun facts - spike-, great! Use reference group don’t worry centering thing. - Yes, radEmu “can handle” longitudinal data. put quotes ’s question get asked lot, vacuous question lot different things “can ” longitudinal data. radEmu can probably want. Use cluster argument check tutorial. Ok, interpreting radEmu output. don’t talk ?! important. corncob coefficient estimate 0.5 means something totally different ALDEx2 estimate 0.5, one seems talk ! Anyway, ’s interpret radEmu estimate 0.5 using default settings: “estimate . bacterium 1.648 times abundant [environment ] [otherwise similar] / [ environment B ] compared typical fold-changes taxon abundances.” 1.648? ’s just exp(0.5). “otherwise similar” important ’re adjusting variables – ’s another option: “estimate . bacterium 1.648 times abundant [environment ] [ environment B ]’s temperature season, compared typical fold-changes taxon abundances.” gets bit wordy, ’s important clear comparison ’re making. (don’t worry “otherwise similar” ’re adjusting variables.) Also, ’re finding radEmu slow, let us know! can help tune , helps us know people using method. yet done done soon (Feb 2025): updated preprint make intro clearer, add benchmarking – great work, co-author Sarah! find benchmarking extremely convincing radEmu best power methods control T1E rates. (shouldn’t even consider using methods don’t control T1E rates.) radEmu works great … maybe 2000 taxa? taxa, might want fast approximation method. , watch space. fastEmu friend shortly… Wrap-: really believe radEmu great way differential abundance, , want use . , please check , let us know feedback. ’s something can convince use , tell us, please! questions method, feel free email – might write another blog post radEmu things come . Oh yeah, radEmu affectionate nickname radEmuAbPill. “using relative abundance data estimate multiplicative differences absolute abundances partially identified log-linear models.” Hope clarifies!","code":""},{"path":"https://statdivlab.github.io/blog.html/authors.html","id":null,"dir":"","previous_headings":"","what":"Authors","title":"Authors and Citation","text":"Amy Willis.
